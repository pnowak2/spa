# Modular User Interface

Library with set of good practices and dependencies gathered together to write highly modular, scalable and testable user interfaces for web using javascript and related technologies.
The main goal is to build a set of reusable UI components which are highly configurable, well tested and easy to use.
This library was written using TDD methodology and has test coverage close to 100%.
Please always write tests for each feature you develop or change (see testing section of this manual).
